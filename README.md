# <p align='center'>Active Shooters Callout</p>
## Description
The <strong>Active Shooter Callout</strong> will spawn between 2-5 shooters at one of several random locations throughout the map. There is a chance some of the shooters will shoot at nearby pedestrians, or possibly wander the area near their spawnpoint. Once a player gets within range of the callout, the shooters will target them instead. Additionally any other players that respond as backup could potentially be shot at as well. Enemy blips are not added on purpose to increase the difficulty of the callout.

## Installation
#### Option 1: Build it yourself
Download the project from Releases, open it in Visual Studio. Build the project to create the ActiveShooters.net.dll file, which should be in the 'bin\Debug' folder in the project solution. Place that file in your callout folder at 'fivepd\callouts' .
#### Option 2: Download the callout at GPM

## Updates
I plan to keep this callout updated as new versions of FivePD are released.
